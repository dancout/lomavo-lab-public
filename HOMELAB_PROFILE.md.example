# My Homelab Profile

Quick reference for me and my AI agent. Update as hardware changes.

## Hardware Inventory

| Machine | Hostname | Role | Key Specs |
|---------|----------|------|-----------|
| [e.g. Raspberry Pi 4 8GB] | rpi | DNS, proxy, core services | ARM64, 8GB RAM |
| [e.g. Gaming PC, Windows 11] | gaming-pc | Media server, AI inference | RTX 3080, 32GB RAM |
| [e.g. QNAP NAS TS-433] | nas | Storage, monitoring stack | 4x4TB RAID 5 |

## Network

- LAN subnet: `10.0.0.0/24`
- Router IP: `10.0.0.1`
- Pi-hole VIP (if using HA DNS): `10.0.0.X`

## Experience Level

[e.g. Senior developer (10 years: Angular, Python, Node). New to infrastructure and homelabbing.]

## Goals

What I want to run:
- [ ] Ad-blocking DNS (Pi-hole)
- [ ] Photo library (Immich)
- [ ] Password manager (Vaultwarden)
- [ ] Media server (Jellyfin)
- [Add your own goals here]

## Current Phase

[e.g. Phase 1 in progress: basic network setup, SSH, first services.]

## Deviations from Reference Architecture

[Note where your setup differs from the original owner's, e.g. "No QNAP NAS — using Synology DS923+"]
