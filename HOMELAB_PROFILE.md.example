# My Homelab Profile

Quick reference for your hardware inventory, experience level, and setup. Share this with your AI agent to help it understand your constraints and resources.

## User Profile

- **Experience**: [e.g. Senior developer (10 years: Angular, Python, Node), new to homelabbing]
- **Specializations**: [e.g. Web development, mobile development]
- **Language Preferences**: [e.g. Prefer strongly typed languages; pragmatic about JavaScript where necessary]
- **Goals**: [What you want to run: DNS, storage, media server, monitoring, etc.]

## Active Homelab Hardware

### Primary Machines

| Machine | Role | Key Specs |
|---------|------|-----------|
| [e.g. Raspberry Pi 4 8GB] | DNS, core services, monitoring | ARM64, 8GB RAM, Ethernet |
| [e.g. Gaming PC Windows 11] | Docker, media, compute | [CPU model], [GPU], [RAM], [storage] |
| [e.g. QNAP TS-433] | Storage, HA failover, NAS services | [CPU], [RAM], [RAID config], [2.5GbE] |

### Network Infrastructure

- **Router**: [e.g. Xfinity gateway at 10.0.0.1]
- **Switch**: [e.g. TrendNet 2.5G connecting all machines]
- **DNS HA**: [e.g. Pi-hole primary on Pi, backup on NAS, virtual IP for failover]
- **Network Diagram**:
  ```
  [Router] → [Switch] → [Pi, Gaming PC, NAS]
  ```

## Available Storage (Not Currently Integrated)

### External Drives

- [e.g. 1TB WD Blue SATA with USB adapter — for bulk backup/staging]
- [e.g. 500GB portable drive — for off-site backup]
- [e.g. USB thumb drives (8GB typical) — for boot media, tools]

### Potential Uses

[List ideas: incremental backup staging, disaster recovery, data transfers, etc.]

## Available Hardware (Not Currently Deployed)

### Undeployed Equipment

- [e.g. Extra Raspberry Pi 4 or Libre Computer — could become DNS failover, monitoring node, or edge compute]
- [e.g. WiFi USB dongle]
- [e.g. Bluetooth USB dongle]

### Deployment Ideas

[What could you do with this hardware?]

## Legacy Hardware (Not In Service)

### Old Machines

[e.g. 2011 MacBook Pro with ~400GB encrypted data + free space — potential recovery or lightweight client project]

## Hardware Constraints & Considerations

[Document any limitations: RAM, compute, storage capacity, network bottlenecks, SSH quirks, platform-specific issues, etc.]

## Future Expansion Possibilities

[What could grow your setup: additional nodes, storage consolidation, new services, hardware upgrades, etc.]

## Current Phase

[e.g. Phase 1 in progress: basic network setup, SSH, first services]

## Deviations from Reference Architecture

[Note where your setup differs from the original owner's, e.g. "No QNAP NAS — using Synology DS923+" or "Using Unraid instead of Docker Compose"]
