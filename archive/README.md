This directory is populated by `scripts/new-user-setup.sh` when you initialize the repo for your own homelab. It contains:

- **`completed-example.md`** — Original owner's build log (lomavo-lab)
- **`next-steps-example.md`** — Original owner's task queue (lomavo-lab)

These files are valuable learning references. Read them to understand HOW services were deployed, what bugs were hit, and the sequence of decisions. But they are **not** your current state — your AI agent reads YOUR `completed.md` and `next-steps.md`.
